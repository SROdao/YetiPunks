                    deep in the valhalla mountains live the YETIPUNKS.
                    far away from civilization and far away from the chaos.
                    they live a simple life, filled with good vibes and only the best herb.
                    the water from the ice cap mountains is filled with magical nutrients that grows nugs the size of a tree in the redwood forest.
                    all YETIPUNKS have different traits and features but they pride themselves on inclusivity and community.
                    they're always down to lend a helping hand, so never fearâ€¦
                    you will always have a fren in the YETIPUNKS
